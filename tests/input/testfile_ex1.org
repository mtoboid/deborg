* Header1
** Subheader1 ([[https://github.com/examplesite/project][github link]])
   + package
   + package2
   + package-with-hyphens
   + package5-hyphen

* Header 2
  Some information text which we want to have in our file but don't want to
  parse. This can span several lines and could include tags such as ~code~ or
  even =verbatim text=. We also don't want to exclude it might contain + or -,
  however, they can't be at the start of a line!
  
  + packageX :: some comments about that package

  (this is actually an illegal Debian package name, but it is not up to us to
   fix this. The package manager will complain and then the typo in the file
   can be fixed.)
    
* More complex patterns
  Here we check that we can parse all the pattern-types we want to include.
** 1 - basic
   + basic-package1

** 2 - basic + comment
   + basic-commented-package2 :: some comment

** 3 - package and distro for which it should be installed
   + package-dist3 {distro}

** 4 - package and distro for which it should be installed (commented)
   + package-dist4 {distro} :: some comment here

** 5 - different packages for different distros
   + package-distA5 {distroA}, package-distB5 {distroB}

** 6 - different packages for different distros (commented)
   + package-distA6 {distroA}, package-distB6 {distroB} :: and some comment

** 7 - package with distro and release
   + package-distA7 {distroA:release1}

** 8 - package with distro and release (commented)
   + package-distA8 {distroA:release1} :: and again some comment

** 9 - different packages for different distros, releases
   + package-distA9 {distroA:release1}, package-distB9 {distroA:release2}

** 10 - different packages for different distros, releases (commented)
   + package-distA10 {distroA:release1}, package-distB10 {distroB:release2} :: comment here

** 11 - one general package only different for one specific distro + release
   + package-distA11, package-distB11 {distroB:release1}

** 12 - same package for all releases of one distro, but specific one for one specific release
   + package-distA12 {distroA}, package-distB12 {distroA:release2}
